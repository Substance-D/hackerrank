# hackerrank
A repository of solutions for every hackerrank problem I've ever solved from Easy Solve Me Firsts to Hard problems and everything in between.

Any solutions for problems which begin with a programming language name will be listed without the language name e.g. Java Primality test will be listed as PrimalityTest.java in the relevant folder.

Any solutions where removing the programming language name will cause a conflict with existing classes in that language will be prepended with "HR" e.g. Java BigDecimal will be listed as HRBigDecimal.java
