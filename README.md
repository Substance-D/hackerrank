# hackerrank
A repository of solutions for every HackerRank problem I've ever solved from Easy Solve Me Firsts to Hard problems and everything in between.

Any solutions for problems which begin with a programming language name will be listed without the language name e.g. Java Primality test will be listed as PrimalityTest.java in the relevant folder.

Any solutions where removing the programming language name will cause a conflict with existing classes in that language will be prepended with "HR" e.g. Java BigDecimal will be listed as HRBigDecimal.java

Solutions do contain some modification in locked areas however none of these change the solutions much. Some are simply renaming the class rather than call them all Solution as this would prevent them compiling outside of the HackerRank environment. Also some formatting modification e.g. opening curly braces on a newline instead of the same line or removing "your code here" type comments

Sometimes import statements are added or removed though generally none are removed from locked sections. Any added import statements can all be easily written in the code instead as needed e.g.

import java.util.Arrays;

Arrays.sort(...)

Can be replaced with

java.util.Arrays.sort(...)
